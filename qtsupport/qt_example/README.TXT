To build and run this Qt example:

1) Make sure you have the Qt development packages installed

2) Make sure that you have muscled compiled and running ("cd muscle/server; make; ./muscled displaylevel=trace")

3) In this folder, build the qt_example ("qmake; make")

4) Run the qt_example program (Under Linux, "./qt_example"; under MacOS/X, "./qt_example.app/Contents/MacOS/qt_example", under Windows, "Debug\qt_example.exe")

5) (optional) run other copies of qt_example and connect them to the same server

6) Click and drag in the upper area to set your client's state; you can see other clients' state in the areas as well.
